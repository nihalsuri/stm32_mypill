# stm32_mypill
Personal take on the STM32 line of pill devices 

* This project is made in KiCAD 6.0 and is a basic and simple breakout board for the STM32F103C8T6. 

* All the files required for manafacturing purposes are in the "manafacturing" folder which is a part of the **stm32myPill** directory.
